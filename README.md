# Drug Classification Project

## Short Description
This project uses machine learning models (Support Vector Machine and Naive Bayes) to classify drugs based on patient data, including age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol, and sodium-to-potassium ratio.

## Getting Started
This guide will help you set up and run the project locally. The code processes a CSV dataset and evaluates classification models.

### Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have:
- Python 3.8 or above installed.
- Libraries: pandas, sklearn.

### Installing
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/drug-classification.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd drug-classification
   ```
3. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *(Note: Create a `requirements.txt` file if not already available with the necessary libraries.)*

4. Place the `drugdataset.csv` file in the project directory.

### Running the Tests
1. Open the terminal and navigate to the project folder.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python drug_classification.py
   ```

### Breakdown of Tests
The project evaluates two models:
1. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**:
   - Achieves 100% accuracy on the test data.
   - Requires normalized features for optimal performance.

2. **Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)**:
   - Achieves 90% accuracy on the test data.
   - Works well with both continuous and categorical data but shows slight misclassification for one drug type.

Evaluation metrics:
- **Classification Report**: Provides precision, recall, and F1-score for each drug type.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Highlights true and predicted classifications.

### Deployment
To deploy this project, you can:
1. Run it on a local machine for analysis.
2. Use Jupyter Notebook or similar tools to visualize results.
3. Extend it for integration into a web application (e.g., Flask or Django).
